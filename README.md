# Python conferences

Here is a list of Python conferences around the world.

Each CSV file is [compatible with Google Calendar](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37118?hl=en). If would like to add a conference, please [submit a pull request](https://github.com/python-organizers/conferences/pulls).

If you are a conference organizer, we can give you direct access to the repository, but it is your responsibility to update your own event! The goal is to make it easier for *speakers, instructors, sponsors* to find your conference.
